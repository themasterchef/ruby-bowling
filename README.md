# ruby-bowling

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/themasterchef/ruby-bowling.svg?branch=master)

Fun with 10-pin bowling in Ruby using a functional programming approach.

Within the FP sections of the code base, Haskell conventions are often used, as they
give a nice succinct way to express FP techniques like list comprehension - in which
x, y, and z are often used to represent the specific head elements of arrays - this comes
from the x:y:z:xs syntax of Haskell.

## Usage

To run, just run the following in the Terminal:

    cd [bowling_folder]
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake spec
